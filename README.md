# Terraform Blue-Green Deployment Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the implementation of blue-green deployments using Terraform, facilitating minimal downtime and risk by maintaining two synchronized production environments.

## Overview
The tutorial covers:
- Provisioning of networking resources including VPCs, security groups, and load balancers.
- Deployment of web servers to establish a blue environment.
- Configuration of an additional set of web servers for a green environment.
- Integration of feature toggles for flexible deployment strategies.
- Execution of a canary test and the incremental promotion of the green environment.

## Prerequisites
- Terraform installed.
- Familiarity with AWS services, notably EC2 and VPC.
- Access to an AWS account.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- **Networking**: Set up a VPC with necessary security groups and load balancers.
- **Blue Environment**: Deploy the initial web servers that will handle live traffic.

### 2. Green Environment Setup
- Provision a second set of web servers ready to transition from the blue environment.

### 3. Feature Toggles Implementation
- Integrate feature toggles to control traffic flow between environments.

### 4. Canary Testing
- Initially route a small fraction of traffic to the green environment, monitoring for performance and stability.

### 5. Environment Promotion
- Incrementally redirect traffic to the green environment until it serves all production traffic.

## Conclusion
This tutorial offers a structured approach to leveraging Terraform for blue-green deployments, enhancing CI/CD processes by mitigating risks associated with updates and releases.
